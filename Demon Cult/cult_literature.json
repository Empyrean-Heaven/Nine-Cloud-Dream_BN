However, with the fall of an unwanted invader, the paradigm shifted. Content no more, humans walked towards the light, or what they thought was the light. They chased the glory of stars, not realizing the stars were luring them in.\"",

Names were gifted to things of all kinds, including humans themselves. Grunts and groans would not suffice. Talents who etched sounds across surfaces produced the first words of man. It was a tale of two brothers, both had the same power but vastly different ideals.\"",

It waned in its towering palace of gold and gems and hid itself behind the edge of the world. In darkness, people encountered First Fear. The moon arose to help, yet its brightness was weak and feeble. Yet for many, it was enough. A group of builders sought to reinvigorate the spark of sky and they disappeared off West. Men asked where they were going. 'West. How far? As far as necessary. If twenty is not enough, twenty times twenty.'\"",

One said this, the other said that. Divided, we became. In the clouds a King forged a tower of dreams to unify the will. The people tore it down, proclaiming the will belonged only to the one who pilfered divinity. How dare they. The King was distraught, but it was no use. The songs were broken and splintered. Man would never hear the voice again.\"",
