In places he called 'cities' mankind walked amongst one another without asking for one another's martial attainment at a moment's glance. No man walked away free from murder simply by claiming it was a duel. No woman was forced to toil for her master merely because she was one realm lower than the master. No bullish elders fought visciously to maintain their martial level. It was a world, that existed here and now. If only we could grasp it! Strong enough to have it all; too weak to take it!\"",

Judging folks by their prowess of throwing punches! Mr. X kicks a tiny bit better than Ms. Y, so clearly Mr. X was in the right! Mr. A could hurl a horseshoe nine-hundred feet, and by grace of this fabulous feat he is definitely superior to Mr. B in every way who could only throw it eight-hundred feet! Haha! Haha!\"",
