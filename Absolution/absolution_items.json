    "description": "A small, circular piece of pure gold that has been gilded with the initials A and B. The cursive letters give the item an air of nobility, although strangely enough it seems that B must've been added on later as the design and form of the two letters are distinct from one another. While A appears grand and almighty, B feels like a poor imitation of it. Besides this, nothing much of any particular note stands out from this innocent piece of yellow metal.",
