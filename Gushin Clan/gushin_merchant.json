We toiled as their lapdogs for all of civilization. Through conquests, wars, rebellions, schizms, you name it. This was due to their overwhelming might. With the unfolding of recent events however, our higher-ups have learned that Absolution has stretched their forces too thin. They are losing ground as we speak. It is time for Gushin to take off the shackles binding them to Absolution! We must stand proud as one family, one household! Are you with us or against us?",

They are merely to be a distraction. Now, at long last, Absolution has sent one of its representatives to handle this situation. That is where you come in. Head over to the bandit camp and take down the representative. I doubt the bandits will be of much trouble to the representative, so strike after he has depleted at least a nominal amount of power battling them. This is our only chance. Be prepared.

      "success": "Oh, I knew you could do it! I just knew it! This is wondrous news my friend! Although it will take some time for the whole of Gushin to find out, this is still a start! You see, each bundle of Gushin territories is presided over by a local Absolution representative. And we just killed the one overseeing this place! The main Absolution bigwigs won't know of our brave renegade act until at least months later! By then, we would have outclassed their already struggling selves! Haha! Revolution! Say it with me!
